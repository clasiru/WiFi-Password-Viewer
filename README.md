If you want to modify my codes then you can use Batch file, but if you want to just use my program, then I recommend you to use the executable version of the same program.


Batch File: [WiFi_Password_Viewer.bat](WiFi_Password_Viewer.bat)

Executable File: [WiFi_Password_Viewer.bat](WiFi_Password_Viewer.exe)
